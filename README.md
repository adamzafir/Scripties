  Scripties is your personal speech practice coach – a place to draft your
  scripts, rehearse aloud, and get automatic feedback on your delivery so you
  can walk into your presentation feeling prepared and confident.
  
  > Ever stayed up till 3am trying to complete that script you're preparing
  > for tomorrow?
  > Scripties is here to help you write, edit, and practice more effectively.


  ## Features

  ### Script Writing & Management

  - Create, edit, and save scripts
      - Maintain a library of all your speeches and presentations.
      - Scripts are automatically sorted so your most recent work is always at
        the top.


  ### Teleprompter Practice

  - Teleprompter-style view
      - Practice your script with a clean, focused reading view.
      - The current line is visually highlighted to help you stay on track.
  - Adjustable text size
      - Choose from preset font sizes or fine-tune a custom size so the script
        is readable from your preferred distance.
  - Voice-guided progression
      - As you speak, Scripties uses speech recognition to follow along and
        advance through your script, helping you read more naturally instead of
        constantly scrolling by hand.


  ### Recording & Playback

  - Record your practice sessions
      - Capture unlimited recordings on-device while you rehearse.
  - Playback for self-review
      - Listen to your practice runs and catch parts that sound rushed, unclear,
        or awkward.


  ### Automatic Feedback

  Scripties focuses on two key metrics that strongly affect how your speech
  feels to an audience:

  - Words Per Minute (WPM)
      - Estimates your speaking speed over time.
      - Shows you where you land relative to a recommended WPM range (e.g. too
        fast, too slow, or just right).
      - Visual gauge + text explanation so you know how to adjust.
  - Consistency Score (CIS)
      - Measures how consistent your pauses and pacing are.
      - Encourages you to avoid both overly choppy delivery and long, awkward
        gaps.
      - Uses a 0–100% score with an ideal “green band” range and simple guidance
        like
        “Take less pauses”, “Take more pauses”, or “Keep it up!”.

  Each practice session produces a review that includes:

  - Your WPM score
  - Your CIS (consistency) score
  - An audio replay of your speech


  ### Progress Over Time

  - Per-script review history
      - Reviews are attached to specific scripts, so you can track how your
        delivery improves for each talk.
      - View past sessions to see changes in your pacing and consistency before
        important events.


  ### Onboarding & UX

  - Guided first-run experience
      - A short onboarding flow explains the core ideas of Scripties: writing,
        practicing, and improving with feedback.


  ## Availability
  - Primary Use Case: Speech practice, presentations, public speaking rehearsals
